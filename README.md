# os3-taxonomy-constructor AKA: milk-dud

The Acquisition Analytics Team within GSA's Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) is responsible for developing reporting and analytic visualizations for nine acquisition categories specific to Best-in-Class (BIC) and Transactional Data Ruling (TDR) data. To support these efforts, this project will ingest quarterly BIC/TDR data reports and map the individual product descriptions to the team's pre-defined product taxonomy. It may also re-define the taxonomy along the way.
