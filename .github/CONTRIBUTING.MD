# Contributing
We'd love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. If you're a Fed on the team, then you'll follow the The **The Shared Repository Model**. If you're anybody else, you'll follow the **Fork and Pull Model**

## The Shared Repository Model (Feds Only)
### Short Version
When you want to work on something, clone the repository and make a new branch for your feature. As you implement changes, commit them to your local branch. Then, push that branch to the GitHub remote and make a pull request. Include issue numbers in commit messages and the pull request message if applicable.
### Long Version
#### Writing your Code
1. `clone` the repository:
`$ git clone https://github.com/GSA/os3_taxonomy_constructor.git`
2. `checkout` a branch for your feature before doing anything:
`$ git checkout -b shiny-new-feature`
3. Do some work, staging files you've edited for commit like this:
`$ git add [file.name]`
 You can `add` one, several, or all modified files. To add all, use a dot:
 `$ git add .`
 4. `commit` those changes to your local branch.
 `$ git commit`
 5. To `push` those commits to the remote repository as a non-master branch, run:
 `git push origin shiny-new-feature`
 6. This will create a shiny-new-feature branch on the origin repository, ie. the repository on GitHub.
 7. You should now be able to see your branch on the origin repositor. To make the Pull Request, click on your branch name. Then, click the "Pull Request" button, either on the top right of the screen, or in the center of the page under the label "Your recently pushed branches:". Click the Send Pull request button. Await someone's code review.

 #### Reviewing your Code
 You can review pull requests at https://github.com/GSA/os3_taxonomy_constructor/pulls. If you like the code, you can merge it into master by pressing the big green Merge button. And then you're done!

 If there's a gray bar saying "This pull request cannot be automatically merged.", then you've got some more work ahead of you. That's because the file(s) that your pull request modifies was/were updated in the meantime. To avoid a conflict on the remote, GitHub won't let you automatically merge into master. This means you need to update your Pull Request by merging the origin's master branch into your feature branch. In short, you need to “merge origin master” in your branch:
```
git checkout shiny-new-feature
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
```
If there are no conflicts (or they could be fixed automatically), a file with a default commit message will open, and you can simply save and quit this file.

If there are merge conflicts, you need to solve those conflicts. See [this](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/) for an explanation on how to do this. Once the conflicts are merged and the files where the conflicts were solved are added, you can run `git commit` to save those fixes.

If you have uncommitted changes at the moment you want to update the branch with master, you will need to stash them prior to updating (see the [stash docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning)). This will effectively store your changes and they can be reapplied after updating.

After your feature branch has been update locally, you can now update your pull request by pushing to the branch on GitHub:
`git push origin shiny-new-feature`

#### Deleting your Branch
Once your feature branch is accepted, you’ll probably want to get rid of the branch. You can do that to the remote master right within the pull request page. To delete the branch locally, you need to pull the remote master down into your local master. Then git will know it's safe to delete your branch.
```
git checkout master
git pull
```
Now that your local master is even with the remote, you can do:
`git branch -d shiny-new-feature`
Make sure you use a lower-case -d, or else git won’t warn you if your feature branch has not actually been merged.

## The Fork and Pull Model
This model is the same as the Shared Repository Model except that you need your own fork to work on the code. To to this, you go to the project page and hit the Fork button. You will then want to clone your fork to your machine and add an "upstream remote":

```git https://github.com/GSA/os3_taxonomy_constructor.git os3_taxonomy_constructor-yourname
cd os3_taxonomy_constructor-yourname
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GSA/os3_taxonomy_constructor.git
```
This creates the directory `os3_taxonomy_constructor-yourname` and connects your repository to the upstream (main project) repository. Once you've done this, make your branch, write some code, add and commit your changes, push your forked feature branch’s commits, make your pull request, and await review.

## Any contributions you make will be under the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same Creative Commons License that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/GSA/os3_taxonomy_constructor/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
This might not be strictly enforced, but this is generally a good thing.
